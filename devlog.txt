Battle for the dark star:

Enemy AI: -> always turn to target and move forward results in a small constant bumping when too close
Enemy AI: -> some states have conditions in them external of the 'make decision' paradigm [ a strafing run would start at one end of the ship and end at the other, so that enemy would check when it reaches the end NOT wait to 'make decision']
