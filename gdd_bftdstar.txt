Battle for the dark star:

Dark souls + Star fox -> with a Battlestar Galactica theme [Humans vs Robots (simple is better, no need to  get clever obscuring Cylons. Wear inspiration as a badge)]
--Use clever movement and positioning to defeat enemies
    e.g.: 
        -get behind and shoot them down while they cannot shoot you
        -Fly through difficult terrain to cause the enemy to impact the enviroment and hurt themselves while you escape
        -maneuver so enemies attempting to shoot you from different directions miss and shoot each other
        -trade shots with an enemy while trying to [bullet hell style] avoid their incoming shots

--Collect money to improve your current loadout:
    e.g.:
        -repair fighters
        -upgrade fighters
        -repair fleetships
        -upgrade fleetships
        -use fleetship abilities
        -maintain fleetship abilities
        -buy consumables like missiles or flares
    Done by: Killing enemies, finding treasure, finishing events

--Explore to find NPCs to bring back to the fleet or find upgrades
    e.g.:
        -Find Npcs to bring back to the fleet.
        -Find new upgrades to the fleet
        -Find targets[Events/bosses] for special bonuses or overall progress.
        -Use the right ship type/loadout for each area/zone/mission [e.g.: landmaster tank for planetary stuff. Viper for space, Raptor for hauling items/npcs etc]

        




Player:

Enemies: 
    F.E.A.R enemy tactics
    Lean into the robotic AI of the enemy

    Ai:
        --brain power:
            Enemies make decisions at intervals based on their 'brain power'
                --e.g.: every Xseconds assess the state of the world and make a decision.

Enemy Fleet: Acts similar to the player's talent tree to confer benefits to the enemies, either globally or locally[current map/zone] depending on the specifics of each Enemyfleetship type

        
NPCs:


Fleet: 
    Acts like a talent tree to confer benefits, generate or hold resources for the player. Lost if the ship is destroyed.
    Talent tree:
        -Generate or hold resources.
        -Provides stat improvements.
        -Provides special abilities. [e.g. call orbital strike]


Progression:



Movement:
    3rd person:
        camera: Controled by the right analog stick or the mouse to look in the direction the player directs it.
                -or looks at the target if locking on.
                Roll is orientation is controlled by the camera.
        ship:
        >> the Ship is two objects. The entire system which the primary velocity, damage, collision are on, and the secondary system [collider for the ship] which can move lateral in place without the enite ship moving
            --allows the player to react quickly and dodge attacks in a small area but cannot make major movements in lateral directions 
            Engines:
                -Rotates to face the camera direction at a speed determined by the engines.
                    --can be a toggle to have the ship only rotate when moving
                -Propel the ship forward based on its current facing NOT the facing of the camera
                    --can be a toggle to have it be camera relative.
                -Lateral movement relative to the camera within a designated boundary
                    -- when at the boundary max the entire ship system adds that lateral movement to the target velocity
                  
    External forces: Collisions, getting shot, losing stamina, or firing weapons like a rail gun apply external forces that the engine tracks and includes in its calculations.
        --Handled by the engine and modified by the enviroment [high friction, gracity etc]

Enviroment Levels:
    Enviroment type determine gravity, friction, and ambient forces [e.g.: Sand decreases engine effectiveness increases durability loss]




--comparison to dark souls:

Souls:
Player Respawns:
Enemy Respawns:
Upgrades:




Thoughts and design whiteboard:
    Pursuit: If always being pursued it needs to be core to everything being a time pressure and not just skill decision in battle. Pursuit as an addition would probably feel comubersum to the player.
            -- could it be a special sometimes event e.g.: being pursued until X happens/is killed, or for X jumps?
        --Or part of a Back4Blood corruption cards mechanic since the enemy fleets work as a talent tree already.
                >> Pursued until the ship giving the pursuit benefit is destroyed OR the player finds a way to hide the fleet and escape? >> I like that

    stamina/fuel: ?? fuel is a consumable that you spend to fll your stamina bar when adventuring?? risk/spend less fuel but have less stamina or vice versa
